### Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5
**Say Hello to HTML Elements**
-Your answer goes here if you struggled with this lesson


### Basic CSS
**Margin vs Padding**
-At first I struggled to fully comprehend and visualize the difference between margin and padding due to the fact that they have similar functions. After looking up articles and watching youtube videos on the subject matter, I was able to better understand the difference between margins and padding, and their improtance when it comes to making better design decisions for your website.

### Responsive Web Design Principles
**Make Typography Responsive**
-At first it was hard for me to understand the concept of using viewport units to size text due to the fact that I could not visualize what was going on. After completing the exercise, I decided to look up a video to further explain this concept and I was able to better understand it once I was able to see it being applied in action. 

### Basic JavaScript
**Switch Statements**
-It took me a little while to understand when to use switch statements in place of if else statements. After further studying the concepts I was able to see that deciding whether to use if-then-else statements or a switch statement is based on readability and the expression that the statement is testing. I now understand that it all comes down to whichever design is clearer and more maintainable as per the demand of your code.

### Basic JavaScript
**Generate Random Fractions and Whole Numbers**
I understood the concept of the lessons and the general structure of the code, I just needed to play around with a few examples before I fully felt confortable with the Math.floor and Math.random() functions.
