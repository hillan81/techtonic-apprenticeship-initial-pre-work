            <h2>About The Artist</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in Brooklyn NY, Marvin Dolo has been releasing music since 2017. 
               Through eight project releases, he has bounced back and forth between the most
               experimental walls of hip-hop and his own uniquely enigmatic brand of R&B. One
               project may demonstrate Dolo’s more melodically inclined romantic side whereas
               another will exemplify his contribution to the bass-thumping hip-hop wave.
               Marvin Dolo has proved himself to be spectacular in his creative bipolarism and
               if you’re a fan of hip-hop, R&B, and what the two scenes are becoming at the 
               hands of the world’s most experimental and wide-ranging musicians, you’ll love
               each of his 8 projects.</p>
